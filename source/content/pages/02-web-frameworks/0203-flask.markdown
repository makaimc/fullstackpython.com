# Flask
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a Python web framework built with a 
[small core and easy-to-extend philosophy](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/design/).

## Why is Flask a good web framework choice?
Flask is considered more Pythonic
than Django because Flask web application code is in most cases more explicit. 
Flask is easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little 
boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running. 

For example, here's a valid "hello world" web application with Flask (the
equivalent in Django would be significantly more code):

    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello World!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

Flask was also written several years after Django and therefore
learned from the Python community's reactions as the framework evolved.
Jökull Sólberg wrote a great piece articulating to this effect in his 
[experience switching between Flask and Django](http://jokull.calepin.co/my-flask-to-django-experience.html).


## Flask resources
The 18-part Flask mega tutorial is an absolutely amazing starting 
resource for using the Flask framework. Yes, there are a lot of posts in 
the series. However, each post is focused on a single topic to contain 
the complexity while the reader is learning the framework. The whole 
series is well worth an in-depth read-through. The 
[author](https://twitter.com/miguelgrinberg) is also wrote the new
[O'Reilly Flask Web Development](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031116.do)
book which is an excellent learning resource.
