# Python 2 or 3?
The Python programming language is currently in the midst of a long-term
transition from version 2 to version 3. New programmers typically have many
questions about which version they should learn. It is confusing to hear
that Python 3, which was originally released in 2008, is still not the default
installation on some operating systems.

Here's the good news: you can't go wrong starting with either version. While 
there are differences in unicode and syntax, for the most part if you 
start with Python 2 and then learn Python 3 you won't be starting from 
scratch. Likewise, you'll be able to read and write Python 2 code if you 
started with Python 3.

That said, my personal recommendation for new programmers as of right 
now is to use Python 3, specifically 3.6 as of January 2017. There are 
enough [great resources](/best-python-resources.html)
out there that teach version 3 from the ground up. Python 3 is the future
and you will not regret starting with the latest version of the
programming language.

However, if you are interested in DevOps-type work with 
[configuration management tools](/configuration-management.html) such as 
Ansible or Fabric, then you'll have to stick to Python 2 because they have
yet to upgrade to support Python 3. If you know there are libraries you must
use in a project, check the 
[Python Walls of Superpowers](https://python3wos.appspot.com/). 


### Visualizations and Projects
Since upgrading from Python 2 to 3 has been such a huge undertaking within
the community, many projects have sprung up to make the transition easier.

* [six](https://pythonhosted.org/six/) is a 2/3 compatibility library that
  is a dependency for many popular Python projects to make it easier to
  support both Python 2 and 3 at the same time.

* [Python 3 Readiness](http://py3readiness.org/) is a visualization of
  which most popular 360 libraries (by downloads) are ready to be
  used with Python 3.

* The [Python clock](https://pythonclock.org/) counts down the time until
  Python 2.x is no longer maintained. While in 2016 Python 2's retirement
  may seem a long time away, it can take a lot of time and effort to migrate
  existing application to the modified syntax in 3.x.


### Porting to Python 3 resources
Moving an existing codebase to Python 3 from 2 can be a daunting task,
These resources were created by fellow developers who've previously
gone through the process and have advice for making it less painful.

* [Python 3 Porting](http://python3porting.com/) is an entire book with
  details for how to upgrade your existing projects and libraries to 
  Python 3.x.
  
* [Moving from Python 2 to Python 3](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/promotions/python/python2python3.pdf)
  is a PDF cheatsheet for porting your Python code.

* The official 
  [porting code to Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PortingToPy3k/)
  page links to resources on porting Python code as well as underlying C
  implementations. There is also a 
  [quick reference for writting code with Python 2 and 3 compatibility](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PortingToPy3k/BilingualQuickRef).

* [Django and Python 3 How to Setup pyenv for Multiple Pythons](https://godjango.com/96-django-and-python-3-how-to-setup-pyenv-for-multiple-pythons/)
  is a screencast showing how to run both Python 2 and 3 for different
  projects using pyenv.

* [Upgrading to Python 3 with Zero Downtime](https://tech.yplanapp.com/2016/08/24/upgrading-to-python-3-with-zero-downtime/)
  supplies advice on transitioning a large existing Python 2 web application 
  to Python 3. Their process involved upgrading dependencies, testing and
  deploying the new version before going back to clean up unnecessary code
  created by the transition.


### Python 2 to 3 resources
* [Why should I use Python 3?](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/07/31/python-faq-why-should-i-use-python-3/)
  is a detailed FAQ on important topics such as unicode support, iteration
  improvements and async upgrades provided by 3.x.

* Want to know all of the advantages and what's changed in Python 3 
  compared to Python 2? There's 
  [an official guide to Python 3 changes](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html)
  you'll want to read.

* [Python 3 in 2016](https://hynek.me/articles/python3-2016/) explains
  that many newer Python developers have only used Python 3 and as that
  cohort continues to grow it will have an outsized impact on further
  adoption.

* [Python 3 is winning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2016/03/08/python-3-is-winning/)
  presents data and graphs from PyPI to show that at the current rate,
  by mid-2016 overall Python 3 library support will overtake Python 2 
  support.

* [The stages of the Python 3 transition](http://www.snarky.ca/the-stages-of-the-python-3-transition)
  provides perspective from a core Python developer on how the transition from
  Python 2 to 3 is going as of the end of 2015.

* [Rules for Radicals: Changing the Culture of Python at Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRtp9NgtXiA)
  is a fascinating look at how Facebook moved from primarily Python 2
  up to Python 3 due to the efforts of a small passionate group of
  developers within the company. Definitely worth watching to understand
  how to shift a large organization with an established codebase.

* [Porting to Python 3 is like eating your vegetables](http://nothingbutsnark.svbtle.com/porting-to-python-3-is-like-eating-your-vegetables)
  explains that there are treats in Python 3 that are worth porting for and
  has some tips on making the transition easier.

* [Scrapy on the road to Python 3 support](http://blog.scrapinghub.com/2015/08/19/scrapy-on-the-road-to-python-3-support/)
  explains from the perspective of a widely used Python project what their
  plan is for supporting Python 3 and why it has taken so long to make it 
  happen.

* All major scientific Python libraries have 
  [pledged to drop Python 2 support](https://python3statement.github.io/)
  no later than 2020, when Python 2's maintenance life is over. The pledge 
  strongly encourages Python 3 adoption by publicly stating their
  intentions. 

* Only 28% of dependencies still only support Python 2, according to 
  [this post's analysis of 6000 Python libraries](https://medium.com/broken-window/python-3-support-for-third-party-libraries-dcd7a156e5bd).
  The other 72% of libraries either support both Python 2 & 3 (14%), or only 
  support Python 3 (58%).

* [There isnâ€™t really a Python 2 vs Python 3 Problem](http://pythonforengineers.com/there-isnt-really-a-python-2-vs-python-3-problem/)
  tries to cut past the concern about the Python 2 vs 3 divide and explain
  that it's really not a major concern as a Python programmer. The 
  recommendation to new programmers is to use Python 3 and for experienced 
  developers to keep your explanation simple: Python 3 is where to begin.
