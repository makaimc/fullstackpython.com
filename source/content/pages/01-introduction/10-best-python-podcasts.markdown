# Best Python Podcasts
The [Python community](/python-community.html) produces an incredible wealth 
of free and low cost resources for both new and experienced software 
developers. These great resources include several Python podcasts that are 
released on a regular schedule.

Note that podcasts that have not been updated in the past twelve months 
are not included on this page.


## Favorite podcast episodes
Here are a list of my favorite episodes from various Python podcasts before 
we dive into entire podcast recommendations in the next section. Dig into
these episodes to get a feel for various personalities and styles in
podcast presentation.

* [SQLAlchemy and data access in Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/5/sqlalchemy-and-data-access-in-python)
  brought me some much-needed context and understanding for how the 
  [object-relational mapping](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html) library
  [SQLAlchemy](/sqlalchemy.html) evolved. This episode interviews 
  SQLAlchemy's creator. The show host, Michael Kennedy, asks great questions 
  based on his in-depth research and prior usage of SQLAlchemy.

* [Deploying Python Web Applications](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/26/deploying-python-web-applications-updated).
  *Spoiler alert*: this is the episode I was on Talk Python to Me explaining
  how [Python web application deployments](/deployment.html) work.


## Python-specific podcasts
* [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm) focuses on the
  people and organizations coding on Python. Each episode features a
  different guest interviewee to talk about his or her work.

* [Podcast.\_\_init\_\_](http://podcastinit.com/) is another regular podcast 
  that presents stories about Python and interviews "with the people who 
  make it great".

* [Test and Code Podcast](http://pythontesting.net/test-podcast/) focuses
  on [testing](/testing.html) and related topics such as mocking and 
  [code metrics](/code-metrics.html).

* [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) is a new podcast from the creators
  of the above mentioned "Talk Python to Me" and "Test and Code Podcast".

* [Import This](https://www.kennethreitz.org/import-this/) is an occasional
  podcast from Ken Reitz and Alex Gaynor with very in-depth interviews with
  influential Python community members.

## General software development podcasts
* [Embedded.fm](http://embedded.fm/)

* [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/)

* [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/)

* [Exponent](http://exponent.fm/) is not a software development podcast
  but it covers the intersection of corporate strategy and technology in an
  in-depth way that allows me to better understand the decisions businesses
  make when building and releasing software. I listen to every episode 
  (at 1.5x speed) and it's well worth the 45 to 60 minutes spent 
  listening to Ben Thompson and James Allworth go deep on a weekly topic.
