# Python Community
The Python programming language has a global community with millions of 
software developers who interact online and offline in thousands of virtual 
and physical locations.


## Who drives the Python community?
There are tens of thousands of Python developers who help steer the
community with local, regional and global events. Most, if not all of them, 
are members of the 
[Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/). The PSF
is a 501(c)(3) non-profit with the mission to "promote, protect, and advance 
the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the 
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers."



## Python community resources
* The [community page on Python.org](https://www.python.org/community/)
  provides a starter page with links to community-run newsletters, resources
  and conferences.

* Clinton Dreisbach wrote two fantastic retrospectives for 
  [PyCon US 2015](http://www.dreisbach.us/blog/pycon-2015/) (his first PyCon)
  and 
  [PyCon US 2016](http://www.dreisbach.us/blog/pycon-2016/). There are
  many other retrospectives for other 
  [community-led conferences such as EuroPython](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=261930).
  These summaries can be a great way to get a slice of the experience
  before purchasing a ticket and booking a trip.

* There are many large active online communities on 
  [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/python), 
  [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/communities/103393744324769547228)
  [IRC channels](https://freenode.net/) such as #python, #python-dev
  and #distutils.
