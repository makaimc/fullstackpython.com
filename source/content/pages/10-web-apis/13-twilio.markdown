# Twilio
[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/twiml) is a 
[web application programming interface (API)](/application-programming-interfaces.html)
that software developers can use to add communications such as 
[phone calling](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/browser-calls/python/django), 
[messaging](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/server-notifications/python/django), 
[video](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/guide/quickstart-js) and 
[two-factor authentication](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/two-factor-authentication/python/flask)
into their [Python](/learning-programming.html) applications.

## Why is Twilio a good API choice?
Interacting with the standard telephone networks to send and receive
phone calls and text messages without Twilio is extremely difficult 
if you do not know the unique telecommunications protocols such as 
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Twilio's API abstracts the 
telecommunications pieces so as a developer you can simply use your 
favorite programming languages and frameworks in your application.
For example, here's how you can send an 
[outbound SMS](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/sms/sending-via-rest) 
using a few lines of Python code:

    # import the Twilio helper library (installed with pip install twilio)
    from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient

    # replace the placeholder strings in the following code line with 
    # your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console
    client = TwilioRestClient("ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "zzzzzzzzzzzzz")

    # change the "from_" number to your Twilio number and the "to" number
    # to any phone number you want to send the message to 
    client.messages.create(to="+19732644152", from_="+12023358536", 
                           body="Hello from Python!")

## How is Twilio's documentation for Python developers?
Twilio is a developer-focused company, rather than a traditional 
"enterprise company", so their tutorials and 
[documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs) are written by developers 
for fellow developers.
