# Future Directions
Full Stack Python has completely blown away my expectations for what I could
accomplish with a side project. I really appreciate all of the in-person 
feedback, emails and pull requests I've received from the community. Keep 
them coming!

For 2017 I am filling in the grayed-out topics on the 
[all topics](/table-of-contents.html) page. I will also address the
tactical fixes and improvements that need to be made which are listed
in the "tactical improvements" section below.


## Other updates
A huge update was released in the form of the
[The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments](http://www.deploypython.com/),
a step-by-step tutorial book for learning how to deploy Python web 
applications.

I am also working with Michael Kennedy of 
[Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm) on our 
[Python for Entrepreneurs](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business)
video course.


## Pull requests and fixes
Note that these plans can change based on 
[pull requests](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/pulls)
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!

Typos, inaccurate statements or general areas for improvement can also 
be handled through an issue ticket or pull request on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/).


## Tactical improvements
Every page on Full Stack Python is a work-in-progress that can always
use improvements. The following items on this list need some love and 
attention.

* [RQ](/redis-queue.html): Add "Comparing Celery and RQ" and 
  "when is RQ useful?" sections.

* [Celery](/celery.html): Add graphics to show how Celeryd and Celerybeat
  work. Also add section on comparing Celery to other task queues.

* [Apache Cassandra](/apache-cassandra.html): Add "why use cassandra?"
  and "what is CQL?" sections.

* [MongoDB](/mongodb.html): Add "why is mongodb useful?" and 
  "database drivers" sections.

* [Redis](/redis.html): Add "why use redis?", "data drivers" sections.

* [Git](/git.html): Add "why use git?", "what is a distributed version 
  control system?", "what's the difference between git and github?" and 
  "git clients" sections.
