## Markdown's origin
Markdown was originally 
[developed by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
in 2004. The markup language's lightweight design helped it gain rapid
adoption by software developers and designers. The format's simplicity also
makes it easier to write parsers to convert the structured syntax into
other formats such as HTML and JSON.
