# Sanic
[Sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic) is a 
[Python web framework](/web-frameworks.html) built on 
[uvloop](https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/) and 
designed for fast HTTP responses via asynchronous request handling.

## What are the tradeoffs of using Sanic?
Sanic cannot be developed or deployed on Windows due to its 
necessary [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) dependency.

## Sanic tutorials
Sanic is under very active development and is still in its infancy as a
web framework. The following tutorials will get you started but there is
a chance you will have to work through errors as Sanic is regularly updated.

* [Getting started with Sanic: the asynchronous, uvloop based web framework for Python 3.5+](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/12/getting-started-with-sanic-the-asynchronous-uvloop-based-web-framework-for-python-3-5.html)
  is a "Hello, World!" style post for the framework and also shows how
  to respond to SMS text messages using [Twilio](/twilio.html).

* [Fixing bugs and handling 186k requests/second using Python](https://hackernoon.com/fixing-bugs-and-handling-186k-requests-second-using-python-2e75d2f9f4f6)
  is a fun benchmarking exercise that a developer ran when testing out 
  Sanic on a Digital Ocean droplet.

* [Exploring Asyncio - uvloop, sanic and motor](http://masnun.rocks/2016/11/17/exploring-asyncio-uvloop-sanic-motor/)
  explains why asyncio is important to the Python community and how
  uvloop & sanic fit into the bigger picture.

* [Python Sanic Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiGsWfwh0yY) is a
  video tutorial on how to write your first Sanic web apps.
